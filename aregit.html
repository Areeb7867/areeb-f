<p  style="text-align:center; " ><b>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute
    respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). <br>It was first identified in December
    2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has resulted in an ongoing pandemic. As of 12 August 2020, <br>
    more than 20.4 million cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting
    in more than 744,000 deaths. More than 12.6 million people <br>have recovered.</b></p><br>

<h2>Precautions to prevent from Covid-19 </h2>
<h3>1. Wash your hands frequently and carefully</h3>
<p>Use warm water and soap and rub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Work the lather to your <br>
    wrists, between your fingers, and under your fingernails. You can also use an antibacterial and<br>
    antiviral soap.</p>

<h3>2. Avoid touching your face</h3>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 can live on some surfaces for up to 72 hours. You can get the virus on your hands if <br>
    you touch a surface like:

gas pump handle,
your cell phone,
a doorknob.</p><img src="pic2.jfif" width="200" height="100">
<h3>3. Stop shaking hands and hugging people — for now</h3>
<p>Similarly, avoid touching other people. Skin-to-skin contact can transmit SARS-CoV-2 from one<br>
    person to another.</p>
